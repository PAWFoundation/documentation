We have started migrating PAW tokens to PAW Chain. New PAW coin serve an important role as native tokens used on the PAW Chain. PAW holders should swap their old PAW using a migration contract.

>This is a 1:1 swap, which means that anyone who holds PAWs token will receive the same amount of PAW coins. There is no reduction in the token supply.

## How to Migrate old PAW tokens to PAW Chain

For any remaining old PAW tokens that have not yet been migrated, we have decided to conduct the migration directly using migration smart contract, rather than using a migration user interface that is no longer supported. This makes the migration process for the remaining old PAW token holders simple.

The migration smart contract, created solely for migration purposes, allows you to migrate your PAW tokens without connecting to any external platforms. The migration smart contract address is open-source, meaning the code can be checked by anyone.

## Steps to Start Migration Process

1. **Access Your Wallet**: Check your PAW balance.

2. **Send Tokens**: Send your old PAW tokens to the migration smart contract address `0xbcEA9ade60dA1f32026c13Ed0405C9e6E847aEA7`. The migration smart contract address begins with `0xbc` and ends with `aEA7`. The case of letters does not matter (lower case or upper case). Choose to send the entire balance of PAW tokens. The migration contract will wait for the full balance to arrive before initiating the migration process to optimize due to high gas fees.

3. **Confirmation**: After the transaction is confirmed and broadcasted to the blockchain, the migration process will start, and your wallet will be credited with new PAW coins. Depending on network usage, it may take 5â€“10 minutes to process the migration.

Your wallet will automatically recognize the PAW Chain, and PAW coin will be credited to your wallet once the migration is complete. Once the migration is complete, you will have new PAW tokens in your wallet. 

Congratulations, you have successfully performed the migration.
